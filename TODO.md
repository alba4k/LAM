      * str
      * num
      * lists (multi-type?)

- [ ] Functions

Technically:
* improve function arg parsing
* function return values
* eval should be able to return NULL (maybe?)
* refactor if/else/while parsing
* break/continue in loops
* change type to save the output to a variable

Major stuff:
* something like `input(var_name)`
* lists
